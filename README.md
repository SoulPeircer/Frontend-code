# Frontend-code
The code has been made in frontend languages: HTML,CSS and JS.
It basically takes a random number from 1 to 100 and then gives you two modes hard and easy and then by the level you choose you can guess the number from either 
hard level that gives you five chances to guess the number or easy level that gives you ten chances to guess the number.
If you guess the number correct if says you are correct and if you are wrong it gives you "you guessed wrong" alert.
This is one of the small projects thati made just to give you a overview on what i do.
